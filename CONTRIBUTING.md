## How to Contribute

- Search [issues](https://github.com/indiana91/devstandup/issues) for work that interests you. Issues labeled `good first issue` are great for beginners.
- If your contribution is minor (typo, small doc fix), feel free to send a pull request (PR) directly.
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss your idea.
- For bug fixes, describe the problem and steps to reproduce.
- For new features, provide motivation and implementation plan if possible.

## Issue Tracking

- **Labels:** We use labels for difficulty (`beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`), type (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.), and `hacktoberfest`.
- **Templates:** Use issue templates when available.
- **Link Related Issues:** If your PR or issue relates to others, mention them using `#<issue-number>`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Fork and create a feature branch (`feature/<your-feature>`, `fix/<your-fix>`, etc.).
- Write clear commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (e.g., `feat: add new theme support`).
- Keep PRs focused and concise.
- Ensure your code passes all tests and linting.
- Link issues your PR solves (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Document new APIs or commands in README.md.
